# Configuring the Gateway

## Configuring the Gateway to produce enhanced access logs

The Gateway provides sophisticated logging capacity, extensively covered [in its own doc](https://www.georchestra.org/georchestra-gateway/user_guide/logging/).

We will only cover the parts relevant to the needs of this module, but reading the dedicated doc is strongly advised for a better understanding.

### Enabling the access logs

As stated in [Gateway#access-logging](https://www.georchestra.org/georchestra-gateway/user_guide/logging/#access-logging,), you can enable the access logs in the datadir's gateway/logging.yaml file with:
```yaml
logging:
  accesslog:
    enabled: true
    # URLs to log at INFO level
    info:
      - ".*/(ows|ogc|wms|wfs|wcs|wps)(/.*|\?.*)?$"
```
With the above configuration, the access logs will be enabled and will only ouput on `info` level (the default) the paths matching the regular expression.
Regular expression filtering of the access logs is useful to avoid bloating the pipeline with undesired content.

You will want to add more patterns to collect more data.

_You don't need to activate the json-logs pattern. OpenTelemetry log collect is not tied to this setting, so you can keep text logs on the console while retrieving json-structured logs through opentelemetry export_.

### Enabling enhanced access logs
It is possible to attach more information to the access logs, like for instance user name, roles, organization and more detailed information about the http requests.
This is done through configuration, in the datadir's gateway/logging.yaml file, as documented in [Gateway#MDC Properties](https://www.georchestra.org/georchestra-gateway/user_guide/logging/#mdc-properties).

For usage data collection, you will at least want to enable :
```yaml

      # User authentication MDC properties
      user:
        id: true
        roles: true
        org: true
        auth-method: true
      http:
        id: true
        method: true
        url: true
        query-string: true
        parameters: true

```

### Exposing the logs over OpenTelemetry protocol

The OpenTelemetry project provides a [java-agent](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/agent/) as a simple means to instrument your software.

To enable OpenTelemetry support on the Gateway:

- download the [OpenTelemetry javaagent](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/releases/latest/download/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar) and store it in the datadir's gateway/libs folder
- add the following _**java options**_ to enable the javaagent with all expected features:
```
-javaagent:/etc/georchestra/gateway/libs/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
-Dotel.javaagent.enabled=true
-Dotel.exporter.otlp.protocol=grpc
-Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://localhost:4317
-Dotel.instrumentation.logback-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=*
-Dotel.traces.exporter=none
-Dotel.metrics.exporter=none
-Dotel.logs.exporter=otlp
```
Beware, those need to be declared as java JVM options, not spring-boot options.

for instance if running the gateway from its source code, in commandline, this would be:
```bash
otel_endpoint=http://localhost:4317
./mvnw -DskipTests spring-boot:run \
    -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev \
    -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="
        -javaagent:/etc/georchestra/gateway/libs/opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
        -Dotel.javaagent.enabled=true \
        -Dotel.exporter.otlp.protocol=grpc \
        -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=${otel_endpoint}   \
        -Dotel.instrumentation.logback-appender.experimental.capture-mdc-attributes=*  \
        -Dotel.traces.exporter=none \
        -Dotel.metrics.exporter=none \
        -Dotel.logs.exporter=otlp \
    "   \
    -pl :georchestra-gateway
```

You will want to adjust the `otel_endpoint` variable to match the Vector instance, in charge of collecting the data.

TODO: provide the environment variable equivalent



!!! note "Some contextual information about logging and the Gateway"

    You might see another way to retrieve access logs. By default, Spring Cloud Gateway reactive, on which the geOrchestra Gateway is built, uses Netty as its internal webserver. 
    Netty can be configured to enable its access logs. But this is not how we manage it in the gateway and, regarding analytics purposes, even though you can use them, you will get poor and less consistent results (no user/org info noticeably)

!!! tip "json-logs"

    You will read on the Gateway's documentation instructions on how to enable JSON log format. And since the user/roles/org information is only visible with the JSON output, you might think that it is necessary for the collection of all interesting information, for analytics purposes.  
    ***It is not***.   
    Those are two separate concerns:

    - json-logs will affect the logs sent to the logs handlers, most commonly the console (or file output). It's up to you to decide if you prefer CLF-like text logs lines, or json records for this.
    - the logs collected using OpenTelemetry will be sent in JSON structure *anyway*, including all MDCs, including user/roles/org information. Provided you https://www.georchestra.org/georchestra-gateway/user_guide/configuration/#userauthentication-mdc-properties for this, of course.
