# Preparation

Ensure first you have

- a working geOrchestra instance
- a working Superset instance. See [georchestra-superset](https://docs.georchestra.org/superset/en/latest/) on how to install and configure it in connection with your geOrchestra instance


## Configure access logs

You will also have to configure the access logs in your Security proxy / Gateway. See the corresponding instructions on the [Configuration section](configuration/index.md).
