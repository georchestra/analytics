# apps_mapping is a dict of app_path:app_name, used to determine which *software* is running for a given path.
# Apps which path match the app name don't have to be listed, unless using multiple DN support, see below.
# App names have to match the name used in this project's app_processors subpackage.
#
# e.g. let's suppose that we have a geonetwork instance running on /catalog. It can't be automatically inferred
# that this is a geonetwork instance. We'll have an apps_mapping entry like this:
#
# apps_mapping:
#   "/catalog/": "geonetwork"
#
# But we're not declaring the geoserver path, because it already corresponds to the geoserver app name.
#
apps_mapping: { }
# Set this to true if you want to collect logs from multiple DNs. Beware that this will affect the apps_mapping above:
# the keys will include the DN, in order to distinguish possibly conflicting paths. So, the default keys won't be
# recognized at all, you will have to be explicit there
